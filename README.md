# Brux-3D
This is a program demonstrating 3D graphics in Brux-GDK

This is a program displaying a 3D cube. Unsure if I'm gonna be able to go further, we need more support for drawing textures in brux for that.
Made in Brux GDK and Squirrel scripting language. Squirrel can be found here: https://github.com/KelvinShadewing/brux-gdk
Brux doesn't provide functions that fills triangles yet which is why there's no texture to this cube what so ever.
